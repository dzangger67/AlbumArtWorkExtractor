A simple C# console application that will allow you to extract all the album art work from your music collection.  It was originally designed to extract the album art work to the folder where the audio files are.  But you can provide your own naming pattern so you can have all the art work exported to a single folder.  The naming of the files is only as good as the data in your audio tags.
